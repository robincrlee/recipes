# How to download transcripts youtube video?

## Why?
The transcripts of youtube videos are helpful to demonstrate success factors of an engaging talk.
The transcripts can be annotated to show the structure, hooks, and key argument of each talk.
Analysts can annotate individual vidoes, or programatticaly analyzing video content at scale.


## Do you know that YouTube has a hidden feature on timestamp and transcript?

## Programatic method
I was able to download the transcript from terminal using the following command line tools
- youtube-dl
- awk 
- sed

To supplement the stackoverflow, I want to convert the downloaded .vtt file into a more human-readable text and save that output in text file.
