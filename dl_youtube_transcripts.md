# How to download transcripts youtube video?

## Why?
I am downloading video transcripts of technical and academic talks on youtube. 
The transcripts can be annotated to show the structure, hooks, and key argument of each talk.
Currently, I am annotating the talk transcript to demonstrate components of an engaging talk.
But this might be useful for analyzing video content at scale.

## Do you know that YouTube has a hidden feature on timestamp and transcript?

## Programatic method
I was able to download the transcript from terminal using the following command line tools
- youtube-dl
- awk 
- sed

To supplement the stackoverflow, I want to convert the downloaded .vtt file into a more human-readable text and save that output in text file.
